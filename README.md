# Purpose
Develop a cli tool to convert xml to json.

# Objectives
1. Extend the [open source json schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html) which can be generated here: [https://jsonschema.net/](https://jsonschema.net/)
2. Process xml using a stream to avoid loading entire xml object into memory.
3. Store data from xml to a Map interface so this can be developed further to write to a external data store.
4. Generate and write json to a stream using the schema as guide and the data store for it's values.
